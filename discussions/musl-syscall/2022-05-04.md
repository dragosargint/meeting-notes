### Agenda

* Current state of ukthread / clone
* Musl integration
* synchronization / futexes

### Discussions

DA: I have a functional version of musl with wrappers enabled, function calls instead of binary system calls, and system call resolved at compilation time (where it can be done.
SK: I am back on the clone call.
SK: I solved the ordering problem (i.e.  uk_threads need to be garbage collected, and this should happen at a certain time)
SK: Working on some wait mechanism.

### TODOs and Decisions
DA: Investigate Clone and TLS
SK: Work on clone and the mechanism to set the TID to 0 when a thread does exit().
